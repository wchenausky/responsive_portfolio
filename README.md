# Responsive Portfolio

In this exersise I have started to learn and put to use, Bootstrap. The purpose of this exercize is help me better understand the functions of Boot strap and it's almost limitless possibilites. I've learned things such as, rows and colums, how to use buttons, inserting pictures and linking individual pages and websites. I really enjoyed the process and can't wait to learn more as I progress on my coding journey.
